## 9. CONCLUSION

This comparative analysis reveals that Croatia and Russia represent two fundamentally different approaches to gastronomy tourism development:

**Croatia** has maximized gastronomy tourism's economic contribution through international market focus, premium positioning, and strong value chain integration. However, this success comes with significant dependency risks and capacity constraints.

**Russia** has underutilized its gastronomy tourism potential in terms of GDP contribution, but maintains economic resilience through diversification. Its domestic model provides stability and significant growth potential.

**Key Insight:** The 50:1 ratio in tourism GDP contribution is not a measure of tourism "success" but rather reflects the fundamental economic structure of each country. Neither model is inherently superior—each represents a context-appropriate development strategy.

**Recommendation:** Countries should develop gastronomy tourism strategies aligned with their broader economic structure, rather than attempting to replicate models from different economic contexts.

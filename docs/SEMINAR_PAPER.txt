                           1. INTRODUCTION
================================================================================

1.1 Research Context and Rationale
----------------------------------

In contemporary tourism, gastronomy has evolved far beyond its traditional role
as a secondary service component. Food and drink have become strategic elements
of destination branding, local economic development, and primary tourist
motivation. The global gastronomy tourism market represents one of the fastest-
growing segments of the tourism industry, with tourists increasingly selecting
destinations based on culinary experiences rather than traditional sun-sea-sand
attractions.

This transformation carries significant economic implications. Gastronomy
tourism creates direct employment in restaurants, hotels, and food services,
while simultaneously generating substantial indirect effects through linkages
with agriculture, food processing, transportation, and retail sectors. The
economic multiplier effects of gastronomy tourism can be particularly powerful
in regions where strong connections exist between local food production and
tourism consumption.

However, the economic impact of gastronomy tourism varies dramatically across
countries depending on their overall economic structure, tourism dependency,
market orientation, and value chain development. This variation provides a
compelling rationale for comparative economic analysis.

Croatia and the Russian Federation represent two contrasting cases that
illuminate the diverse economic roles gastronomy tourism can play:

- CROATIA represents a small, open, tourism-dependent economy where
  international tourism receipts constitute approximately 17-19% of GDP.
  Gastronomy functions as a primary tourism driver, with strong international
  branding and deep integration with local agricultural production.

- RUSSIA represents a large, diversified economy where international tourism
  contributes less than 0.5% of GDP. Gastronomy serves primarily as a cultural
  and domestic consumption asset, with emerging but underdeveloped international
  gastronomy tourism potential.

This contrast offers a unique opportunity to examine how gastronomy tourism
economics differ between tourism-oriented and diversified economies, between
small nations dependent on international visitors and continental powers with
vast domestic markets.


1.2 Research Objectives
-----------------------

This research pursues the following objectives:

1. To analyze the economic contribution of gastronomy tourism to national
   economies in Croatia and Russia, with emphasis on GDP contribution,
   employment generation, and regional development effects.

2. To compare the role of gastronomy as a tourism driver versus gastronomy
   as a cultural and domestic consumption asset in contrasting economic
   contexts.

3. To evaluate the value chain integration between agriculture, food
   processing, hospitality, and tourism in both countries.

4. To assess the effectiveness of gastronomy branding and international
   market positioning in generating economic returns.

5. To identify strengths, weaknesses, opportunities, and threats in
   gastronomy tourism development for both countries.

6. To provide evidence-based policy recommendations for enhancing the
   economic impact of gastronomy tourism.


1.3 Research Questions
----------------------

This paper addresses the following research questions:

RQ1: How does the economic contribution of gastronomy tourism differ between
     a tourism-dependent economy (Croatia) and a diversified economy (Russia)?

RQ2: What role does gastronomy play in tourism motivation and destination
     competitiveness in each country?

RQ3: How effectively are value chains integrated between agricultural
     production, food processing, and tourism consumption?

RQ4: What factors explain the different levels of international market
     integration in gastronomy tourism between the two countries?

RQ5: What strategic approaches can maximize the economic benefits of
     gastronomy tourism in each national context?


1.4 Scope and Limitations
-------------------------

This study focuses on the macroeconomic dimensions of gastronomy tourism,
utilizing secondary data from official statistical sources, international
organizations (UN Tourism, World Bank), and academic literature. The analysis
covers the period 2015-2024, with particular emphasis on post-2020 recovery
trends.

Limitations include:
- Reliance on secondary data with varying levels of gastronomy-specific detail
- Limited availability of recent Russian tourism data due to geopolitical factors
- Difficulty in isolating gastronomy tourism from general tourism statistics
- Cross-country comparison challenges due to different statistical methodologies


1.5 Paper Structure
-------------------

Following this introduction, Section 2 establishes the theoretical framework
for analyzing gastronomy tourism economics. Section 3 describes the methodology
and analytical approach. Sections 4 and 5 present detailed economic analyses
of Croatia and Russia respectively. Section 6 provides systematic comparative
analysis. Section 7 discusses findings and implications. Section 8 concludes
with key insights and recommendations.


================================================================================
                       2. THEORETICAL FRAMEWORK
================================================================================

2.1 Defining Gastronomy Tourism
-------------------------------

Gastronomy tourism, also referred to as culinary tourism, food tourism, or
gastronomic tourism, encompasses travel where the primary or significant
motivation involves experiencing the food and drink of a destination. The
World Tourism Organization (UNWTO) defines gastronomy tourism as "a type of
tourism activity characterized by the visitor's experience linked with food
and related products and activities while travelling" (UNWTO, 2012).

From an economic perspective, gastronomy tourism extends beyond restaurant
dining to include:

- Visits to food producers (farms, wineries, olive oil mills, cheese makers)
- Participation in cooking classes and culinary workshops
- Attendance at food festivals and gastronomic events
- Food-related retail purchases (local products, souvenirs)
- Food tours and guided culinary experiences

This breadth creates multiple economic channels through which gastronomy
tourism generates value.


2.2 Economic Dimensions of Food Tourism
---------------------------------------

The economic significance of gastronomy tourism operates through several
interconnected dimensions:

DIRECT ECONOMIC EFFECTS
- Restaurant and hospitality revenue
- Food retail sales
- Culinary event ticket sales
- Cooking class and tour operator income

INDIRECT ECONOMIC EFFECTS
- Agricultural production for tourism consumption
- Food processing and manufacturing
- Transportation and logistics
- Marketing and promotional services

INDUCED ECONOMIC EFFECTS
- Household spending from tourism-generated income
- Investment in tourism infrastructure
- Tax revenue generation

Research consistently demonstrates that food expenditure constitutes a
substantial portion of total tourist spending. Studies indicate that
tourists typically allocate 25-35% of their travel budget to food and
beverage, with gastronomy-motivated tourists spending even higher proportions
(Gheorghe et al., 2014).


2.3 Tourism Multiplier Effects
------------------------------

The tourism multiplier concept, derived from Keynesian economics, measures
how initial tourism expenditure generates additional economic activity through
successive rounds of spending. In gastronomy tourism, multiplier effects can
be particularly strong when:

1. Local sourcing is high (restaurants use local agricultural products)
2. Labor intensity is significant (hospitality employs local workers)
3. Leakages are minimized (profits remain within the destination)
4. Backward linkages are developed (tourism stimulates local production)

The multiplier formula can be expressed as:

    Tourism Multiplier = 1 / (1 - MPC × (1 - import propensity))

Where MPC is the marginal propensity to consume from tourism income.

Countries with strong local supply chains and limited import dependency
typically exhibit higher tourism multipliers. This theoretical principle
has important implications for comparing Croatia (smaller economy, potential
higher import dependency) and Russia (larger economy, potential greater
self-sufficiency in food production).


2.4 Value Chain Theory in Gastronomy Tourism
--------------------------------------------

The value chain concept, introduced by Porter (1985), provides a framework
for analyzing how economic value is created and distributed across linked
activities. In gastronomy tourism, the value chain includes:

    Agriculture → Processing → Distribution → Hospitality → Tourism → Consumer

Each stage adds value and generates economic returns:

PRIMARY ACTIVITIES:
- Agricultural production (farming, viticulture, animal husbandry)
- Food processing (cheese making, curing, fermentation)
- Distribution and logistics
- Restaurant and hospitality services
- Tourist experience delivery

SUPPORT ACTIVITIES:
- Quality certification and food safety
- Marketing and branding
- Training and skill development
- Infrastructure provision
- Research and innovation

Value chain integration refers to the extent to which these activities are
connected and coordinated within a destination. High integration creates
stronger economic linkages and distributes benefits across sectors and regions.


2.5 Destination Competitiveness and Gastronomy
----------------------------------------------

Destination competitiveness theory (Crouch & Ritchie, 1999; Dwyer & Kim, 2003)
identifies multiple factors that determine a destination's ability to attract
tourists and generate economic benefits. Within this framework, gastronomy
contributes to competitiveness through:

INHERITED RESOURCES
- Traditional recipes and culinary heritage
- Indigenous ingredients and terroir
- Cultural food practices and rituals

CREATED RESOURCES
- Restaurant infrastructure
- Culinary training institutions
- Food festivals and events
- Quality certification systems

SUPPORTING FACTORS
- Transportation accessibility
- Accommodation quality
- Marketing effectiveness
- Policy environment

DEMAND CONDITIONS
- Tourist preferences and motivations
- Market trends toward experiential tourism
- Health and sustainability consciousness

Destinations that effectively leverage gastronomic resources within a
competitive framework can differentiate themselves and command premium
pricing, thereby enhancing economic returns.


2.6 Conceptual Framework for Analysis
-------------------------------------

Based on the theoretical foundations, this paper employs a conceptual
framework that analyzes gastronomy tourism economics across four dimensions:

DIMENSION 1: ECONOMIC CONTRIBUTION
- GDP contribution (direct, indirect, induced)
- Employment generation
- Regional economic distribution

DIMENSION 2: VALUE CHAIN INTEGRATION
- Agriculture-tourism linkages
- Local sourcing rates
- Multiplier potential

DIMENSION 3: MARKET POSITIONING
- International vs domestic focus
- Branding effectiveness
- Competitive differentiation

DIMENSION 4: DEVELOPMENT CONTEXT
- Economic structure (tourism-dependent vs diversified)
- Policy environment
- Infrastructure development stage

This framework guides the comparative analysis of Croatia and Russia in
subsequent sections.

                          3. METHODOLOGY
================================================================================

3.1 Research Approach
---------------------

This study employs a comparative case study methodology, utilizing secondary
data analysis to examine gastronomy tourism economics in Croatia and Russia.
The comparative approach is particularly suited to this research because:

1. It enables identification of how economic context shapes gastronomy
   tourism outcomes
2. It reveals both common patterns and unique features
3. It provides basis for transferable insights and policy learning

The analysis combines quantitative economic indicators with qualitative
assessment of value chains, branding, and policy environments.


3.2 Data Sources and Collection
-------------------------------

Primary data sources include:

INTERNATIONAL SOURCES
- UN Tourism (UNWTO): International tourism arrivals and receipts
- World Bank: GDP data, economic indicators
- World Travel & Tourism Council (WTTC): Tourism satellite accounting

NATIONAL SOURCES - CROATIA

3.4 Limitations of Secondary Data
---------------------------------

Several limitations affect this analysis:

1. SPECIFICITY: Official statistics rarely isolate gastronomy tourism from
   general tourism data, requiring inference from broader indicators.

2. COMPARABILITY: Different statistical methodologies between countries
   may affect direct comparisons.

3. TIMELINESS: Some indicators, particularly for Russia, have limited
   recent availability due to geopolitical circumstances.

4. CAUSALITY: Secondary data analysis can identify correlations but
   establishing causality requires careful interpretation.

These limitations are acknowledged and addressed through triangulation of
multiple data sources and careful qualification of findings.


================================================================================
                   4. ECONOMIC ANALYSIS: CROATIA
================================================================================

4.1 Macroeconomic Tourism Context
---------------------------------

Croatia is a small, open economy where tourism plays a dominant role in
economic structure. With a population of approximately 3.9 million and
GDP of 92.5 billion USD (2024), Croatia has developed one of Europe's most
tourism-dependent economic models.

Key macroeconomic characteristics:

- GDP per capita: 23,932 USD (2024), reflecting upper-middle income status
- Economic structure: Services-dominated (approximately 70% of GDP)
- EU membership since 2013, Eurozone membership since 2023
- Schengen Area membership since 2023

The Croatian economy's openness and EU integration facilitate tourism flows,
particularly from major European source markets (Germany, Austria, Italy,
Slovenia, Poland).


4.2 GDP Contribution and Tourism Dependency
-------------------------------------------

Tourism's contribution to Croatian GDP represents one of the highest levels
globally:

INTERNATIONAL TOURISM RECEIPTS AS PERCENTAGE OF GDP:

    Year    | Receipts (bil. USD) | GDP (bil. USD) | % of GDP
    --------|---------------------|----------------|----------
    2020    | 5.50                | 57.96          | 9.49%
    2021    | 10.80               | 69.01          | 15.65%
    2022    | 13.40               | 71.20          | 18.82%
    2023    | 15.80               | 84.39          | 18.72%
    2024    | 16.20               | 92.53          | 17.51%

Source: UN Tourism Dashboard, 2025; Author's calculations

These figures represent only direct international tourism receipts. When
indirect and induced effects are included, the World Travel & Tourism
Council estimates tourism's total contribution to Croatian GDP exceeds
25% in peak years.

This extreme tourism dependency creates both opportunities and vulnerabilities:

OPPORTUNITIES:
- Strong incentives to develop and maintain tourism quality
- High political priority for tourism sector
- Established international market position

VULNERABILITIES:
- Economic exposure to external shocks (pandemic, geopolitical events)
- Seasonal employment patterns
- Potential over-reliance limiting economic diversification


4.3 Employment Generation
-------------------------

Tourism and hospitality represent critical employment sectors in Croatia:

EMPLOYMENT TRENDS IN TOURISM & TRAVEL SECTOR (thousands):

    Year    | Employment
    --------|------------
    2015    | 90
    2016    | 93
    2017    | 92
    2018    | 103
    2019    | 115

Source: Ministry of Tourism and Sports, Croatia, 2024

The growth from 90,000 to 115,000 jobs between 2015-2019 (28% increase)
demonstrates tourism's role as a dynamic employment generator. However,
this employment is characterized by:

- High seasonality (concentrated in summer months)
- Significant share of temporary and seasonal contracts
- Regional concentration along the Adriatic coast
- Skills requirements ranging from unskilled to professional

Gastronomy specifically contributes to employment through:
- Restaurant and cafe operations
- Hotel food and beverage departments
- Catering services
- Food production (wineries, olive mills, farms)
- Culinary education and training


4.4 Regional Gastronomy Distribution
------------------------------------

Croatian gastronomy exhibits strong regional differentiation, creating
opportunities for tourism diversification:

COASTAL REGIONS (ISTRIA, KVARNER, DALMATIA):
- Mediterranean cuisine influence
- Seafood, olive oil, wine focus
- High international tourism integration
- Premium positioning and pricing

CONTINENTAL REGIONS (SLAVONIA, ZAGORJE, ZAGREB):
- Central European influences
- Meat, grain, dairy products
- Lower tourism integration
- Emerging gastronomy tourism potential

This regional variation supports product diversification and can help
address seasonality by promoting continental gastronomy tourism in
shoulder seasons.


4.5 Key Gastronomic Products and Economic Value

================================================================================
                    5. ECONOMIC ANALYSIS: RUSSIA
================================================================================

5.1 Macroeconomic Context
-------------------------

Russia presents a fundamentally different economic context for analyzing
gastronomy tourism:

KEY CHARACTERISTICS:
- World's largest country by area (17.1 million km²)
- Population: approximately 146 million
- GDP: 2,174 billion USD (2024)
- GDP per capita: 14,889 USD (2024)

ECONOMIC STRUCTURE:
- Diversified but resource-dependent economy
- Strong industrial and energy sectors
- Large domestic market
- Complex regional economic variation

Russia's economic scale and diversification mean that tourism, while
economically significant in absolute terms, represents a marginal share
of overall economic activity.


5.2 Tourism in a Diversified Economy
------------------------------------

Tourism's role in the Russian economy differs fundamentally from Croatia:

INTERNATIONAL TOURISM RECEIPTS AS PERCENTAGE OF GDP:

    Year    | Receipts (bil. USD) | GDP (bil. USD)  | % of GDP
    --------|---------------------|-----------------|----------
    2020    | 3.90                | 1,493.08        | 0.26%
    2021    | 4.00                | 1,829.19        | 0.22%
    2022    | 5.60                | 2,291.61        | 0.24%
    2023    | 6.80                | 2,071.51        | 0.33%
    2024    | 7.60                | 2,173.84        | 0.35%

Source: UN Tourism Dashboard, 2025; Author's calculations

International tourism contributes less than 0.5% of Russian GDP, compared
to approximately 18% in Croatia. This 50-fold difference in relative
contribution shapes fundamentally different policy priorities and
development dynamics.

However, in absolute terms, Russian tourism is substantial:
- International receipts of 7.6 billion USD (2024)
- Domestic tourism spending significantly larger
- Employment of over 1.1 million in tourism sector (2019)


5.3 Domestic vs International Tourism
-------------------------------------

Russia's tourism economy is primarily domestic-oriented:

CHARACTERISTICS OF DOMESTIC TOURISM:

    Tourism % of GDP             | 17.51%     | 0.35%       | 50:1
    Tourism Employment (000s)    | 115        | 1,122       | 1:9.8

Key observations:

1. Despite Russia's much larger economy (23.5x), Croatia generates higher
   absolute tourism receipts (2.1x) from international visitors.

2. Tourism's relative economic contribution differs by a factor of 50
   (17.51% vs 0.35% of GDP).

3. Russia employs approximately 10x more people in tourism, but from a
   population 37x larger than Croatia.

4. Croatia's GDP per capita exceeds Russia's by 60%, partly reflecting
   successful tourism-driven development.


6.2 Tourism Dependency Analysis
-------------------------------

CROATIA - HIGH DEPENDENCY MODEL:

Characteristics:
- Tourism as primary economic driver

- Social media enabling direct communication

COMPARATIVE INSIGHT:

Croatia demonstrates how smaller destinations can build strong gastronomy
brands through consistent positioning and quality focus. Russia's larger
scale and diversity create branding complexity requiring different
approaches.


6.5 Value Chain Integration
---------------------------

VALUE CHAIN INTEGRATION COMPARISON:

    Dimension               | Croatia        | Russia         | Assessment
    ------------------------|----------------|----------------|------------
    Agriculture-Tourism     | Strong         | Developing     | Croatia leads
    Local Sourcing Rate     | High (60-70%)  | Moderate (30%) | Croatia leads
    Processing Integration  | Well-developed | Fragmented     | Croatia leads
    Quality Certification   | Advanced       | Emerging       | Croatia leads
    Agritourism Development | Mature         | Early stage    | Croatia leads
    Scale Potential         | Limited        | High           | Russia leads
    Diversity               | Regional       | Continental    | Russia leads

Croatia demonstrates more mature value chain integration, benefiting from:
- Smaller scale facilitating coordination
- EU quality frameworks (PDO, PGI)
- Longer tourism development history
- International market pressure for quality

Russia has greater potential scale but requires:
- Coordination mechanisms across vast territory
- Quality standardization development
- Tourism-agriculture connection building
- Regional destination development


6.6 Economic Multiplier Effects
-------------------------------

MULTIPLIER POTENTIAL COMPARISON:

CROATIA:
- Estimated tourism multiplier: 1.8-2.2
- High local sourcing increases multiplier
- Seasonal leakage (imported labor) reduces multiplier
- Small economy limits absorption capacity

RUSSIA:
- Estimated tourism multiplier: 1.4-1.6
- Large economy provides absorption capacity
- Import substitution potential high
- Regional variation significant

GASTRONOMY-SPECIFIC MULTIPLIERS:

Gastronomy tourism typically generates higher multipliers than general
tourism due to:
- Labor intensity of food services
- Agricultural backward linkages
- Local product sourcing potential
- Reduced import leakage

Croatia's stronger value chain integration suggests higher gastronomy-
specific multipliers despite smaller economy.

================================================================================
                           7. DISCUSSION
================================================================================

7.1 Key Findings Interpretation
-------------------------------

This comparative analysis reveals several important findings:

FINDING 1: ECONOMIC STRUCTURE DETERMINES GASTRONOMY TOURISM'S ROLE

The 50-fold difference in tourism's GDP contribution (17.51% vs 0.35%)
reflects fundamental differences in economic structure, not simply
differences in tourism quality or potential. Croatia's small, open
economy naturally gravitates toward tourism specialization, while
Russia's diversified economy relegates tourism to a supplementary role.

Implication: Development strategies must align with economic structure
rather than attempting to replicate models from different contexts.

FINDING 2: ABSOLUTE VS RELATIVE IMPORTANCE CREATES DIFFERENT INCENTIVES

Despite lower relative importance, Russia's tourism sector employs
nearly 10 times more people than Croatia's. This absolute scale creates
different stakeholder dynamics and policy priorities.

Implication: Policy and investment decisions should consider both
relative economic significance and absolute employment and revenue
generation.

FINDING 3: VALUE CHAIN INTEGRATION IS A KEY DIFFERENTIATOR

Croatia's stronger value chain integration between agriculture,
processing, and tourism generates higher economic multipliers and
better distributes benefits across sectors and regions. This integration
has developed over decades of tourism-oriented development.

Implication: Gastronomy tourism development requires long-term value
chain building, not just marketing and promotion.

FINDING 4: INTERNATIONAL BRANDING EFFECTIVENESS VARIES WITH MARKET FOCUS

Croatia's strong international gastronomy brand reflects both strategic
marketing and the imperative created by international market dependence.
Russia's limited international brand partly reflects the sufficient
domestic market that reduces export pressure.

Implication: Branding strategies should match market orientation, with
export-oriented destinations requiring stronger international positioning.


7.2 Policy Implications
-----------------------

FOR TOURISM-DEPENDENT ECONOMIES (CROATIA MODEL):

1. Diversification Within Tourism:
   - Develop gastronomy tourism to extend seasons
   - Promote regional distribution beyond coastal areas
   - Encourage premium positioning over volume growth

2. Risk Management:
   - Build economic buffers for tourism shocks
   - Develop contingency plans for crisis periods
   - Consider selective diversification beyond tourism

3. Value Chain Strengthening:
   - Maintain and enhance agriculture-tourism linkages
   - Support small producer integration
   - Invest in quality certification and standards

FOR DIVERSIFIED ECONOMIES (RUSSIA MODEL):

1. Regional Development Tool:
   - Use gastronomy tourism for regional economic development
   - Support destination development in gastronomic regions
   - Coordinate regional marketing and branding

2. Domestic Market Development:
   - Prioritize domestic gastronomy tourism growth
   - Develop regional gastronomy routes and circuits
   - Support festival and event development

3. Selective International Development:
   - Focus international marketing on niche segments
   - Develop specific regional brands rather than national
   - Target accessible markets with cultural interest


7.3 Theoretical Contributions
-----------------------------

This research contributes to gastronomy tourism theory by:

1. Demonstrating how economic structure shapes gastronomy tourism
   development paths

2. Identifying two distinct development models (export-oriented vs
   domestically-focused) with different success factors

3. Highlighting the importance of value chain integration as a
   determinant of economic impact

4. Showing that tourism dependency creates both opportunities
   (investment incentives) and vulnerabilities (shock exposure)


7.4 Practical Implications
--------------------------

FOR DESTINATION MANAGERS:

- Assess economic context before adopting development models
- Prioritize value chain development alongside marketing
- Match market focus (international vs domestic) with resources
- Consider long-term sustainability of chosen development path

FOR TOURISM BUSINESSES:

- Invest in local sourcing relationships
- Develop quality certification and standards
- Build authentic stories and experiences
- Collaborate with agricultural and processing sectors

FOR INVESTORS:

- Evaluate tourism dependency as risk factor
- Consider value chain investment opportunities
- Assess market access and branding potential
- Understand regional development dynamics


================================================================================
                          8. CONCLUSION
================================================================================

8.1 Summary of Main Findings
----------------------------

This comparative analysis of gastronomy tourism economics in Croatia
and Russia has revealed fundamental differences in how gastronomy
contributes to national economies:

1. Tourism contributes 17.51% of Croatian GDP versus 0.35% of Russian
   GDP, representing a 50-fold difference in relative economic
   significance.

2. Croatia has developed gastronomy as a primary tourism driver with
   strong international branding, while Russia's gastronomy serves
   primarily domestic consumption and cultural functions.

3. Value chain integration between agriculture, processing, and tourism
   is substantially more developed in Croatia, generating higher
   economic multipliers.

4. Both countries face distinct challenges: Croatia's extreme tourism
   dependency and seasonality versus Russia's international market
   integration barriers and development fragmentation.


8.2 Key Comparative Insights
----------------------------

The comparison illuminates several key insights:

INSIGHT 1: Economic structure shapes gastronomy tourism's role more
than inherent gastronomic quality or potential. Croatia's tourism
orientation and Russia's diversification reflect broader economic
contexts rather than gastronomy-specific factors.

INSIGHT 2: Strong value chain integration is essential for maximizing
gastronomy tourism's economic impact. Marketing alone cannot generate
the multiplier effects that create broad-based economic benefits.

INSIGHT 3: International branding effectiveness relates closely to
market orientation. Export-dependent destinations require stronger
international positioning than domestically-focused markets.

INSIGHT 4: Neither the high-dependency tourism model nor the
diversified economy model is inherently superior. Each creates
different opportunities and risks that must be managed strategically.


8.3 Policy Recommendations
--------------------------

FOR CROATIA:

1. Continue developing gastronomy tourism as a seasonality mitigation
   tool, with specific focus on autumn/winter experiences.

2. Expand continental gastronomy tourism to reduce coastal concentration.

3. Strengthen value chain integration through producer-restaurant
   partnerships and quality certification.

4. Build economic resilience through strategic diversification while
   maintaining tourism excellence.

FOR RUSSIA:

1. Prioritize domestic gastronomy tourism development as a regional
   economic development tool.

2. Develop coordinated regional gastronomy brands rather than
   attempting unified national positioning.

3. Invest in value chain development linking agricultural production
   to tourism consumption.

4. Target selective international markets with authentic, differentiated
   experiences.


8.4 Future Research Directions
------------------------------

This analysis suggests several avenues for future research:

1. Quantitative measurement of gastronomy-specific tourism multipliers
   in different economic contexts

2. Longitudinal analysis of value chain development and its economic
   impacts

3. Consumer research on gastronomy tourism motivations across markets

4. Policy effectiveness evaluation for gastronomy tourism development
   programs

5. Climate change impacts on gastronomy tourism sustainability


8.5 Final Remarks
-----------------

Gastronomy tourism represents a significant and growing economic
phenomenon, but its impacts and development paths vary fundamentally
across different economic contexts. The contrast between Croatia and
Russia demonstrates that successful gastronomy tourism development
requires strategies aligned with national economic structure, market
orientation, and development stage.

For small, tourism-dependent economies like Croatia, gastronomy tourism
offers a path to differentiation, value addition, and sustainable
development. For large, diversified economies like Russia, gastronomy
tourism can serve as a regional development tool and cultural asset
with emerging international potential.

In both cases, the economic impact of gastronomy tourism depends
critically on value chain integration, quality development, and
strategic market positioning. Countries seeking to develop gastronomy
tourism should focus not only on marketing and promotion but on
building the productive connections that transform culinary heritage
into broad-based economic benefit.
